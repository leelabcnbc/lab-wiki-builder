Eric Xing's comments on this paper, from his Facebook:

Not surprisingly, most statistical learning theories on generalization errors cannot be applied on deep learning, and DL is actually not learning any patterns -- they are just memorizing the data.

Some details.

In 3.3, the Mercer's condition is proved for K tilde, not K. But this should not matter, since we already get a \phi for K tilde (P), then we can define the \phi'(P) for K as \phi(P) / \sqrt{K tilde (P,P)}.},
